### Tenant Management (Super Admin)
- Add new tenants with Cloudflare API tokens
- Assign tenant administrators
- View system statistics
- Manage bot configuration

### DNS Management
- Switch between tenants
- View and manage domains
- Create, edit, and delete DNS records
- Support for all DNS record types with validation

### Tunnel Management
- Create new Cloudflare tunnels
- Configure public hostnames for applications
- Set up private network routing
- Monitor tunnel status and connections
- Delete tunnels when no longer needed

## Tunnel Usage Examples

### Creating a Tunnel
1. Go to "üöá Manage Tunnels"
2. Click "‚ûï Create New Tunnel"
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "home-server")
4. Save the generated secret securely

### Adding Public Hostnames
1. Select your tunnel
2. Click "‚ûï Add Hostname"
3. Enter the subdomain (e.g., "app.example.com")
4. Enter the service URL (e.g., "http://localhost:8080")

### Setting Up Private Networks
1. Select your tunnel
2. Click "üåê Add Network"
3. Enter the CIDR range (e.g., "192.168.1.0/24")

### Running Cloudflared
After creating a tunnel, run on your server:
```bash
# Install cloudflared
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb

# Run your tunnel
cloudflared tunnel run your-tunnel-name
```

## Database Schema

The bot uses SQLite by default with the following tables:
- `tenants`: Store tenant information and API tokens
- `domain_groups`: Group domains for easier management
- `user_sessions`: Track user sessions and current context
- `bot_config`: Store bot configuration and settings

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access Control**: Super admins and tenant admins
- **Token Validation**: Cloudflare API tokens are validated on creation
- **Secure Storage**: API tokens are stored securely in the database
- **Access Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes

## Architecture

### Multi-tenant Design
- Each tenant represents a separate Cloudflare account
- Tenant admins can only access their assigned accounts
- Super admins have global access and can manage the bot

### Caching System
- Domains and tunnels are cached for performance
- Automatic cache refresh when switching tenants
- Manual refresh option available

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## API Integration

The bot integrates with multiple Cloudflare APIs:

### DNS API
- `/zones` - List and manage DNS zones
- `/zones/{zone_id}/dns_records` - CRUD operations for DNS records

### Zero Trust Tunnels API
- `/accounts/{account_id}/cfd_tunnel` - Tunnel management
- `/accounts/{account_id}/cfd_tunnel/{tunnel_id}/configurations` - Tunnel configuration
- `/accounts/{account_id}/cfd_tunnel/{tunnel_id}/connections` - Monitor connections
